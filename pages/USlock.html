            <p class="img">Los Alamos National Laboratory's concept of a space nuclear reactor system to produce high-power electricity</p>
            <br>
            <p>Lockheed Martin has been handed a contract to work on nuclear-powered spacecraft technologies.</p>
            <p>
                The U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) awarded $33.7 million to Lockheed Martin as part of the 
                Joint Emergent Technology Supplying On-Orbit Nuclear (JETSON) effort to "mature high-power nuclear 
                electric power and propulsion technologies and spacecraft design."
            </p>
            <p>
                JETSON aims to launch a fission reactor that will be started up once in space. The reactor will generate 
                heat, which is then transferred to Stirling power converters to produce electricity. This can then be 
                used to power spacecraft payloads or electric thrusters for propulsion.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The reactor builds on NASA's earlier Kilopower Reactor Using Stirling Technology (KRUSTY) demonstration 
                in 2018."Nuclear fission development for space applications is key to introducing technologies that could 
                dramatically change how we move and explore in the vastness of space," Barry Miles, JETSON program 
                manager and principal investigator at Lockheed Martin, said in a statement.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                "From high-power electrical subsystem and electric propulsion to nuclear thermal propulsion or fission 
                surface power, Lockheed Martin is focused on developing these systems with our important government 
                agencies and industry partners," Miles added.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                On JETSON, Lockheed will work with Space Nuclear Power Corp (SpaceNukes) and BWX Technologies, Inc. 
                (BWXT), both of which have expertise in nuclear power and reactor design. The project is currently in 
                the preliminary design review stage, with the option to go to critical design review level."A future 
                JETSON flight experiment will enhance maneuver and power capabilities shaping future space force 
                operations," said Andy Phelps, CEO of SpaceNukes.

                The contract award was announced on Sept. 29, along with contracts for two other players under JETSON.
                Houston-based startup Intuitive Machines also received a $9.4 million contract. It will design a 
                spacecraft concept utilizing a compact radioisotope power system. The startup is also preparing to 
                launch its private moon lander in January. 
            </p>

                In addition, Westinghouse Government Services, based in South Carolina, received a contract to continue 
                research into utilizing high-power nuclear fission systems in spacecraft.The new award to Lockheed 
                Martin is another win for the company in the field of space nuclear power. In July, NASA and the U.S. 
                military chose the aerospace giant to develop and launch a spacecraft to test nuclear thermal propulsion 
                in space. The project, known as DRACO ("Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations"), could 
                feature a propulsion system that's a number of times more efficient than traditional chemical methods.
