            <h1>Sci-Fi Inspired Tractor Beams Are Real, <br> And Could Solve A Major Space Junk Problem</h1>
            <br>

            <p class="img">An artist's illustration shows how an electrostatic tractor beam could be used <br> to pull 
            defunct satellites out of geostationary orbit around Earth. In reality, the <br> beam would be invisible</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In science fiction films, nothing raises tension quite like the good guys' spaceship <br> getting caught 
                in an invisible tractor beam that allows the baddies to slowly reel <br> them in. But what was once only a 
                sci-fi staple could soon become a reality. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <br>
                Scientists are developing a real-life tractor beam, dubbed an electrostatic tractor. <br> This tractor beam 
                wouldn't suck in helpless starship pilots, however. Instead, it would <br> use electrostatic attraction to 
                nudge hazardous space junk safely out of Earth orbit. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The stakes are high: With the commercial space industry booming, the number of <br> satellites in Earth's 
                orbit is forecast to rise sharply. This bonanza of new satellites <br> will eventually wear out and turn the 
                space around Earth into a giant junkyard of <br> debris that could smash into working spacecraft, plummet to 
                Earth, pollute our <br> atmosphere with metals and obscure our view of the cosmos. And, if left unchecked, 
                <br> the growing space junk problem could hobble the booming space exploration industry,<br> experts warn.  
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The electrostatic tractor beam could potentially alleviate that problem by safely <br> moving dead satellites 
                far out of Earth orbit, where they would drift harmlessly for eternity. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                While the tractor beam wouldn't completely solve the space junk problem, the concept <br> has several 
                advantages over other proposed space debris removal methods, which <br> could make it a valuable tool for 
                tackling the issue, experts told Live Science.
