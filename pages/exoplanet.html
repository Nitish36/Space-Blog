            <h1>James Webb Space Telescope detects <br> quartz crystals in an exoplanet's atmosphere</h1>

            <br>
            <p>Thousand-mile-per-hour winds are blowing a hail of tiny quartz crystals through the <br> silicate-enhanced,  
                scorching hot atmosphere of a distant gas giant planet called <br> WASP-17b, the  James Webb Space  
                Telescope (JWST) has found.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                WASP-17b is an incredible world. Orbiting every 3.7 days at a distance of just 7.8 million  <br>
                kilometers  (4.9 million miles) from its star, which sits 1,300 light years away from Earth,<br>
                WASP-17b is so close to  its stellar host that its dayside temperature rises to a staggering <br>
                1,500 degrees Celsius (approximately  2,700 degrees Fahrenheit). Because the <br> atmosphere is so
                hot on this exoplanet, the world has actually  expanded to about <br> 285,000 kilometers 
                (176,892 miles) across, which is just shy of twice the diameter  of <br> Jupiter.
                And that's despite WASP-17b having only about half of Jupiter’s overall mass. <br>
                WASP-17b is one of the "puffiest" planets known — and its bloated atmosphere makes
                it <br> a great target for the  James Webb Space Telescope.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Grant and fellow astronomers watched WASP-17b transit its star using the JWST’s <br> Mid-Infrared 
                Instrument (MIRI). As the exoplanet moved in front of its star from the JWST's <br>  point of view, 
                MIRI  detected starlight that was blocked by the puffy planet itself but partially <br> absorbed by 
                the world's  atmosphere. Such measurements result in a so-called transmission <br> spectrum, whereby
                certain  wavelengths are blocked out by particular atmospheric molecules.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Like Jupiter, WASP-17b appeared to be mostly made from hydrogen and helium. In addition, MIRI <br>
                detected carbon dioxide, water vapor and, at a wavelength of 8.6 microns, the absorption signature <br>
                of pure quartz crystals. Combined with previous observations with the Hubble Space Telescope,  <br>
                these crystals are judged to be shaped like the same pointy, hexagonal prisms as quartz is on 
                Earth, <br> but just a meager 10 nanometers in size.
