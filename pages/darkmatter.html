            <p>
            The Milky Way is twisted, and astronomers may finally know why. They're laying the blame <br> on a 
            football-shaped, tilted halo of dark matter that envelopes our galaxy. The common <br> image of our
            galaxy resembles a flattened disk similar to a vinyl record, but what you <br> might not imagine is the flared
            skirt at its edge structured like the outer ring of a frisbee.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            These features have remained sort of mysterious for quite a while, but now, astronomers from <br> the Center
            for Astrophysics | Harvard and Smithsonian (CfA) have performed calculations that <br> indicate the halo of
            dark matter enveloping the Milky Way could be  "off-kilter," and this could be <br> causing the flared edge and
            warped shape of our galaxy.Not only might this revelation help us <br> better understand the evolution of the
            Milky Way, but it could also reveal more about the nature <br> of dark matter and how it shapes the overall
            development of galaxies.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Dark matter is a challenge for scientists to explain because it does not interact with light,  making <br> it
            effectively invisible and meaning it can’t be made of the same atoms that constitute everyday <br> matter. Yet,
            this mysterious substance makes up as much as 85% of the matter content of the <br> universe, meaning the "stuff"
            that comprises stars, planets, cosmic clouds of dust and even <br> our bodies  —  everything we see around us on
            an everyday basis  —  only accounts for around <br> 15% of the universe’s matter.The only way scientists have 
            been able to infer the presence of dark <br> matter is via its interactions with gravity and the influence this
            has on everyday matter and light. <br> This influence is a fortunate thing, in fact, because galaxies are rotating
            so utterly fast that, in some <br> cases, the gravitational effect of visible matter within these entities
            wouldn’t be sufficient to prevent <br> them from flying apart. Dark matter is the gravitational glue that holds
            galaxies together.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Thus, researchers have deduced that most, if not all, galaxies are wrapped in a halo of dark matter. <br>
                And for the Milky Way, that halo of dark matter is thought to extend out past the halo of stars <br>
                surrounding the galaxy's main disk and central galactic nucleus.
