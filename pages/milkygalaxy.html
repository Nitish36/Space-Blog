            <h1>Milky Way Galaxy:  <br> Everything You Need To Know <br> About Our Cosmic Neighborhood</h1>

            <p class="img">The milky way</p>
            <br>
            <p>The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy around 13.6 billion years old with large <br> pivoting arms 
                stretching out across the cosmos. Our home galaxy's disk is about <br> 100,000 light-years in diameter and 
                just 1000 light-years thick, according to Las <br> Cumbres Observatory.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Just as Earth orbits the sun, the solar system orbits the center of the Milky Way. <br> Despite hurtling
                through space at speeds of around 515,000mph (828,000kmph) <br> our solar system takes approximately 250
                million years to complete a single <br> revolution, according to Interesting Engineering. The last time our
                planet was in this <br> position, dinosaurs were just emerging and mammals were yet to evolve. 
                If the center <br> of  the Milky Way were a city, we would be living in suburbia, about 25,000 to 30,000  <br>
                light-years from the city center. Life in the outskirts  is good; we find ourselves nestled <br> in one of 
                the smaller neighborhoods, the Orion-Cygnus Arm, sandwiched between <br> larger Perseus and Carina-Sagittarius
                arms. If we were to travel inwards towards the <br> city center, we would find the Scutum-Centaurus and Norma
                arms.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                On a clear night, void of light pollution, we can catch a glimpse of the bright lights of <br> the galactic
                city streaking across the night sky. Our window into the universe, this <br> milky white band of stars, dust
                and gas is where our galaxy gets its name.
                Lying at <br> the very heart of the Milky Way is a supermassive black hole called Sagittarius A* <br>. About
                4 million times the mass of the sun, this beast consumes anything that strays <br> too close, gorging on 
                an ample supply of stellar material enabling it to grow into a giant.<br> In 2022, we imaged this glutton 
                at the core of our galaxy for the very first time, through <br> an innovative technique allowing us to view 
                the shadow of the black hole. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Earth is located roughly halfway to the edge of the Milky Way, at a distance of about <br> 26,000 light years
                from the center. We reside in a feature known as the Orion Spur <br> (sometimes also called the Orion Arm), 
                which is an offshoot between the larger Sagittarius <br> and Perseus Arms that lie inwards and outwards of our
                location.
