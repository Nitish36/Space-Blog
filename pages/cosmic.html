            <h1>'Air Showers' Could Help Reveal Cosmic <br> Rays' Mysterious Source</h1>
            <br>

            <p class="img">These cosmic rays typically come from the extremely distant universe, <br>
            apparently from ultrapowerful events such as supernovas and quasars.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Astronomers have a new way to study energetic particles that constantly <br>
                bombard Earth from space,called cosmic rays. The new method proposes the <br> detailed analysis
                of showers of secondary particles created when cosmic rays <br> belt Earth's atmosphere, as a
                lens to better understand them.<br>
                <br>

                Cosmic rays are difficult to track back to a source because the charged particles <br>
                that comprise them are deflected time and again by magnetic fields they <br> encounter as they 
                travel through space at near the speed of light. That means <br> that their sources, which lie outside the solar system, tend to be shrouded in mystery.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Suspects for cosmic ray sources include supernovas, but these particles seem <br> to be too energetic 
                to have been launched even by the explosion of massive stars. <br> Other suspects include active 
                galactic nuclei or quasars powered by feeding <br> supermassive black holes, gamma-ray bursts, or
                even exotic dark matter, but <br> astronomers have yet to find a smoking gun that points to these
                sources definitively.

            <br>
            <p>
                What is better understood is what happens when these charged cosmic particles <br> belt Earth. When
                these charged particles strike particles in our planet's atmosphere, <br> they create a huge 
                "air shower" of secondary particles that rain down to Earth's surface. <br> When thousands, 
                millions or even billions of these particles hit the ground, it's <br> called an extensive 
                air shower.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In the new study, scientists found a way of using precise observations of these particle <br>
                showers taken with the Subaru Telescope, situated atop the Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii, <br>
                to learn more about them and the cosmic rays that trigger them.
