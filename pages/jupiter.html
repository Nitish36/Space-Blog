            <p class="img">Amalthea, the largest of Jupiter's inner satellites, casts a shadow on the giant gas <br>
            planet in this photo taken by NASA's Juno spacecraft. The moon's shadow has an elongated <br> shape because 
            of its position in relation to Jupiter, but also because the moon itself has an <br> odd shape. Because Jupiter 
            has at least 69 moons, solar eclipses like this one are more <br> common than they are here on Earth. </p>
            <br>

                The flyby caused some problems for Galileo. The spacecraft went into safe mode only <br> 30 minutes after 
                going past Amalthea. NASA said it was ready for problems, because <br> Galileo was on its last legs, and the 
                radiation near Amalthea was strong. However, NASA <br> quickly fixed the problem and got Galileo working 
                again.Less than a year later, Galileo <br> threw itself into Jupiter's atmosphere. The spacecraft was crushed by the 
                high pressure <br> in Jupiter's atmosphere, but its data still survives on Earth.
